Hibernate with MySQL.  You will need to make sure you have MySQL installed and create a Database and Table(s) to be used to save data from your application.
Description:
We will apply our knowledge of Hibernate by using your "To Do List" application from Module 2 in order to save its data.  You will want to create a new Hibernate
project like the one demonstrated in the learning materials video.  Then you will add your classes from the "To Do List" application.  Do not try to import Hibernate 
into the old project.  That way you can keep your module assignments separate.
